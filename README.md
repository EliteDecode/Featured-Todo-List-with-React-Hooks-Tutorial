Todo App is a simple and interactive to-do list application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. The app serves as a practical example of effectively using React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for managing state and handling side effects in functional components.
